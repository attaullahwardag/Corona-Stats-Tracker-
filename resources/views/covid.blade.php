            <p>According WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.&nbsp; Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
            <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
